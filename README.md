# Number-bases-

In this repository there are snippets in pure Python 3.x to convert integer numbers.

A number base, or radix, is a set of digits used in a counting system to represent numbers. 

The decimal system, also known as base 10, is the most widely used due to humans having 10 fingers, but other systems exist. 

The pair system, based on twos and ones, is used by some African Pygmies and Australian tribes. Indigenous peoples in South America use systems with bases of three and four, while the quinary system with base 5 is used only by speakers of Saraveca. The pure base 6 system is rare and often combined with the duodecimal system with a base of 12.

The simplest numeral system is the unary numeral system, in which every natural number is represented by a corresponding number of symbols. If the symbol / is chosen, for example, then the number seven would be represented by ///////.

Binary (Base 2) has only 2 digits: 0 and 1
